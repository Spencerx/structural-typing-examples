## Go

Go -- a strong and static typing language -- has no nominal typing, i.e. there is no feature to explicitly define an inheritance relation between types. Instead, Go uses structural typing to state whether an object matches a given type. So a `Wolf` can be typed as a `Duck` if `Wolf` has all the operations declared in `Duck` (type inference).
