## Scala

Scala is a strong, static, nominal, typing language with a small support of structural typing. Scala has no type inference to state whether an object structurally matches a given type. Instead, Scala can declare an object with some structural properties to match to be assigned:

`val theDuck: {def quack:String; def dance:String} = wolf`
