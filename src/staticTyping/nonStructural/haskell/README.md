## Haskell

Haskell is a strong, static, nominal and strucural typing language. The trick is to define a Duck typeclass, then make Mallard an instance of it. Wolf could very well be an instance of Duck, however it makes more sense to use a DuckCosplay that allows him to quack and dance like a Duck.
