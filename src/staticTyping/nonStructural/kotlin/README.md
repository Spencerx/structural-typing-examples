## Kotlin

Kotlin -- a strong, static, and nominal typing language, with type inference and open-class features (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html). The adapter pattern has to be used to encapsulate a wolf into a duck. This is the goal of the class `DuckCosplay`.
Note that Kotlin has the `dynamic` keyword (dynamic typing a la JavaScript) that can be used when targeting JavaScript code (see `src/dynamicTyping/kotlin`).
