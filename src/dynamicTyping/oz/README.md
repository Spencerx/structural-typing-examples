## Oz

Oz has a weak and dynamic type system, so variables do not have an explicit type.

## Building and running

The compilation and running of the program is done through the `ozc` and `ozengine` executable. Those are provided when installing the [Mozart Programming System](https://github.com/mozart/mozart2#downloads).
